#  Artificial Intelligence Course

> A comprehensive exploration of artificial intelligence concepts, algorithms, applications and hands-on projects developed during January - June 2025.

## üìã Course Purpose

This course was designed to provide a solid foundation in artificial intelligence through both theoretical knowledge and practical implementation. The primary objectives were:

1. **Understanding Core AI Concepts**: Exploring fundamental principles that drive modern AI systems
2. **Algorithm Implementation**: Developing coding skills by implementing classic AI algorithms
3. **Interactive Applications**: Creating AI-powered games that demonstrate decision-making algorithms
4. **Practical Experience**: Gaining hands-on experience with various AI paradigms and techniques
5. **Modern AI Tools**: Exploring contemporary AI content creation tools

## üéì What I Learned

### üìä AI Algorithms & Search Techniques

In the [Algorithm-Implementation](./Algorithm-Implementation) section, I implemented and analyzed various search and decision-making algorithms:

- **Uninformed Search Algorithms**: 
  - [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](./Algorithm-Implementation/BFS) for complete, optimal path finding
  - [Depth-First Search (DFS)](./Algorithm-Implementation/DFS) for memory-efficient exploration
  - [Depth-Limited Search (DLS)](./Algorithm-Implementation/DLS) for controlled depth exploration
  - [Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)](./Algorithm-Implementation/Iterative-Deepening-Search) combining BFS optimality with DFS efficiency
  - [Bidirectional Search](./Algorithm-Implementation/Bi-Directional%20Search) for faster path finding by meeting in the middle

- **Informed Search Algorithms**: 
  - [Best-First Search](./Algorithm-Implementation/Best-First-Search) using heuristic evaluation
  - [A* Search](./Algorithm-Implementation/A_star) balancing path cost and heuristic estimation
  - [Beam Search](./Algorithm-Implementation/Beam-Search) for memory-constrained heuristic search
  - [Hill Climbing](./Algorithm-Implementation/Hill-Climb) for local optimization problems

- **Adversarial Search**: 
  - [Minimax Algorithm](./Algorithm-Implementation/Min-Max) for perfect play in zero-sum games
  - [Alpha-Beta Pruning](./Algorithm-Implementation/Alpha-Beta-Prunning) for efficient minimax computation

- **AND/OR Graphs**:
  - [AO* Algorithm](./Algorithm-Implementation/AO_star) for solving problems with multiple solution paths

### üéÆ AI in Games

The [AI-Games](./AI-Games) section showcases practical applications of AI algorithms in interactive games:

- **[Chess](./AI-Games/Chess)**: Implementation of Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for strategic decision making
- **[Connect Four](./AI-Games/Connect-Four)**: Simple heuristic-based AI for competitive gameplay
- **[Tic-Tac-Toe](./AI-Games/Tic-Tac-Toe)**: Perfect play using the Minimax algorithm

These games demonstrate how theoretical algorithms translate into engaging interactive experiences.

  - Transformer models and attention mechanisms
  - Semantic analysis and contextual understanding

- **Robotics and Autonomous Systems**:
  - Perception, planning and control systems
  - Sensor fusion and environmental mapping
  - Robot kinematics and motion planning

- **Intelligent Agents**:
  - Agent architectures and decision-making frameworks
  - Multi-agent systems and emergent behaviors
  - Reactive, deliberative, and hybrid agent approaches

### üîß AI Tools Exploration
