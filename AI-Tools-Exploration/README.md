# AI Course Project: Video & Presentation Using AI Tools

This project was created as part of the **AI Course Final Task**, which included two key deliverables:

1. **A short AI-based video (minimum 1 minute)**
2. **A presentation (10–12 slides) about the AI course**

Both tasks were completed using AI-powered tools as instructed.

## 🎮 1. AI Course Video Creation

### ✅ Tool Used:

* **[Invideo AI](https://invideo.io/ai-video-generator/)**

### 📋 Steps Followed:

1. **Script Preparation**: I wrote a short script summarizing what we covered in the AI course — key topics like:

   * Search Algorithms (DFS, BFS)
   * Minimax Algorithm
   * Game development using Python (e.g., Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe)
   * Real-world applications of AI

2. **Accessed Invideo AI**:

   * Visited [Invideo AI](https://invideo.io/ai-video-generator/)
   * Chose the “AI Video Assistant” option.

3. **Generated Video**:

   * Pasted my prepared script into the text input area.
   * Selected a video style and voice-over options.
   * Let the tool auto-generate scenes, animations, and narration.

4. **Editing & Export**:

   * Made small edits to scene transitions and adjusted timing.
   * Exported the final video (MP4 format, \~1 minute long).
